### Sub Task 1

The paper describes two new methods used to generate a ring-oscillator based PUF. The first is to develop a different configurable ring-oscillator (Figure 6). Your ROs should also use KEEP and S attributes to avoid signal optimization (see potential problems). Design and implement your own configurable ring-oscillator using these requirements.

Connect this Ring Oscillator to the counter and max compare circuit shown in Figure 7. Use this to blink and LED on the Basys board at a rate of once per second. Demonstrate your blinking LED and code to the professor.

### Question 1: What did you change about the provided configurable ring-oscillator?

For the configurable ring oscillator we designed, we changed it to be 6 input instead of 8 input. We don’t need the last two bits because we opted to avoid implementing the fourth and final block. The final block is not necessary for the ring oscillator because ROs need an odd number of stages, so all the fourth block was doing was adding extra delay.
